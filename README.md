# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Visualization  

This project visualizes the **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**, implemented in Java with JavaFX. It provides two interactive modes: **Matrix Visualization** and **Graph Visualization**. Designed for educational purposes, the tool offers an intuitive way to understand shortest path algorithms in weighted graphs.  

##  Features  

### ðŸ”¢ Matrix Visualization  
- Step-by-step updates of the algorithmâ€™s adjacency matrix.  
- Highlights changes during each iteration to demonstrate the algorithm's logic.  
- Displays intermediate states of shortest path calculations.  

### ðŸ“Š Graph Visualization  
- Graphical representation of nodes and edges with weights.  
- Displays shortest paths between nodes once the algorithm processes the graph.  
- **Interactive Features**:  
  - Select a node to view its shortest paths to all other nodes.  
  - Highlight paths between two selected nodes.  

## ðŸš€ Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- **Java 17 or later**: Ensure Java is installed and configured on your system.  
- **JavaFX SDK**: Add JavaFX to your development environment.  
- **Maven or Gradle**: Dependency management tools for building the project.  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zanaad/DAA

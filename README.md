# Language
Project is developed Java language and JavaFX library.

# Usage
The system is designed to calculate and visualize shortest paths efficiently while offering a user-friendly interface. 

Key functionalities include:

    1. Input Handling: Accepts weighted graph data as input, including adjacency matrices or lists.
    2. Shortest Path Calculation: Implements efficient algorithms such as Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's.
    3. Visualization:
       3.1.Matrix Representation: Displays shortest path costs in a tabular format.
       3.2.Graph Representation: Visualizes paths dynamically using JavaFX.
    4. Multi-Source Support:Computes paths from multiple source nodes 
      simultaneously.

Key Sections:

    1. Input Page: Users can upload or manually input graph data.
    2. Result Visualization: Displays computed shortest path costs and dynamic visual representations.
    3. Navigation: Intuitive layout for transitioning between input and visualization screens.
